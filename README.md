# GloomhavenModifierDeck

<h1> Overview </h1>

This is a WIP tool for the board game Gloomhaven, designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games ([link to BoardGameGeek page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven)), that you can use during your Gloomhaven game to check the current (if you're playing a scenario) or overall stats of your attack modifier deck.

This tool will only contain content that my party has unlocked to prevent any spoilers for me, and I will attempt to organize this in such a way to prevent accidental spoilers to anyone else using this tool.

If you have any suggestions or requests, please feel free to log an issue and I'll get back to you the next time I see it.

<h2> Disclaimer on Coding Expertise </h2>

I am an occasional coding hobbyist, nowhere near the level of those who code more than one thing a year, yet I am quite comfortable in Python and Java, and having dabbled in HTML, CSS, and C/C++ in the past. However, I've judged that making this tool in JavaScript would be easiest, so I am learning JavaScript only as I start this project. Please understand this if you ever decide to read my source code and leave any comments - advice would be much appreciated though I will have to read up on this language a bit in order to understand what you are saying =).
