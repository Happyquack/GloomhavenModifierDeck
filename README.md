# GloomhavenModifierDeck

<h1> Overview </h1>

This is a WIP tool for the board game Gloomhaven, designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games ([link to BoardGameGeek page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven)), that you can use during your Gloomhaven game to check the current (if you're playing a scenario) or overall stats of your attack modifier deck.

This tool will only contain content that my party has unlocked to prevent any spoilers for me, and I will attempt to organize this in such a way to prevent accidental spoilers to anyone else using this tool.

If you have any suggestions or requests, please feel free to log an issue and I'll get back to you the next time I see it.
